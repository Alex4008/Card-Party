# Card-Party
Card Party was my attempt at programming a card game with both singleplayer and multiplayer support. 
I only ever finished Euchre (single and multiplayer) and Uno (singleplayer) 

In my opinion, what I did get accomplished is pretty neat, and although I never finished it. I may return to the idea someday. After learning how to properly write a multithreaded program I realize now how many errors I made in development here.
